# Playwright Tricks

A collection of helpful tricks for [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) tests

## Fail test on internal server error, thrown errors, `console.log()`, `console.error()`

Playwright by default will ignore responses with HTTP 500 Internal Server Error, any JavaScript thrown errors on the webpage and usage of `console.log()` and `console.error()` (see [Playwright issue #27277](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/issues/27277))

To make tested applications more robust, fail the currently running test by creating and using a `throwOnErrorsOrConsoleLogging()` function:

`util/playwright.ts`

```ts
import type { Page } from '@playwright/test';

type PagePathnamesToIgnoredMessages = [
  pagePathname: RegExp,
  ignoredMessagePatterns: RegExp[],
][];

type LocationUrlsToIgnoredMessages = [
  locationUrl: RegExp,
  ignoredMessagePatterns: RegExp[],
][];

/**
 * Throw error on any unhandled page errors and console messages
 * (eg. console.log(), console.error(), etc), incl. Content
 * Security Policy (CSP) violations
 *
 * https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/issues/27277#issue-1910304067
 */
export function throwOnErrorsOrConsoleLogging(
  page: Page,
  options?: {
    pagePathnamesToIgnoredMessages?: PagePathnamesToIgnoredMessages;
    locationUrlsToIgnoredMessages?: LocationUrlsToIgnoredMessages;
  },
) {
  page.on('response', (response) => {
    if (response.status() === 500) {
      throw new Error(`HTTP 500 Internal Server Error for ${response.url()}`);
    }
  });

  page.on('pageerror', (error) => {
    throw error;
  });

  page.on('console', (message) => {
    const messageText = message.text();

    const pagePathnamesToIgnoredMessages: PagePathnamesToIgnoredMessages = 
      options?.pagePathnamesToIgnoredMessages || [];

    const pathname = new URL(message.page()?.url() || '').pathname;

    for (const [
      pagePathnamePattern,
      ignoredMessagePatterns,
    ] of pagePathnamesToIgnoredMessages) {
      if (
        pagePathnamePattern.test(pathname) &&
        ignoredMessagePatterns.some((pattern) => pattern.test(messageText))
      ) {
        return;
      }
    }

    const pagePathnamesToIgnoredMessages: PagePathnamesToIgnoredMessages =
      options?.pagePathnamesToIgnoredMessages || [];

    const locationUrl = message.location().url;

    for (const [
      locationUrlPattern,
      ignoredMessagePatterns,
    ] of locationUrlsToIgnoredMessages) {
      if (
        locationUrlPattern.test(locationUrl) &&
        ignoredMessagePatterns.some((pattern) => pattern.test(messageText))
      ) {
        return;
      }
    }

    throw new Error(
      `${messageText} (page pathname: ${pathname}, location URL: ${locationUrl})`,
    );
  });
}
```

To use the function, import the function and call it at the top of your test:

```ts
test('Assessor assesses students', async ({ page }) => {
  throwOnErrorsOrConsoleLogging(page);
```

To disable errors for a specific path or URL, pass in the arrays `pagePathnamesToIgnoredMessages` or `locationUrlsToIgnoredMessages` (or adjust them in `util/playwright.ts`): 

```ts
throwOnErrorsOrConsoleLogging(page, {
  pagePathnamesToIgnoredMessages: [
    [
      /^\/admin\/student-assessments-with-a-typo-in-it$/,
      [
        // Ignore expected HTTP 404 errors
        /^Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 \(Not Found\)$/,
      ],
    ],
  ],
  locationUrlsToIgnoredMessages: [
    /^https:\/\/mozilla\.github\.io\/pdf\.js\/build\/pdf\.mjs$/,
    [
      // Ignore PDF.js console.error() message
      /^Warning: Setting up fake worker\.$/,
    ],
  ],
});
```

Example Playwright logs after failure:

```

    Error: Failed to load resource: net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED (page pathname: /pern-extensive-immersive-fall-2024-atvie/appointments/auth-129, location URL: http://localhost:3000/campuses/atvie?_rsc=15uxf)

```

## Fail test on `webServer` stderr

By default, [Playwright will pipe any stderr output](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-webserver#:~:text=webserver%20environment%20variable.-,stderr,the%20process%20stderr%20or%20ignore%20it.%20Defaults%20to%20%22pipe%22.,-stdout) from any server configured in `webServer` to the process stdout, to show errors in the Playwright logs.

However, often stderr from a server indicates some problem which should be investigated and fixed. One way of achieving this is to fail the currently running test upon any stderr output from the server, as proposed in [Playwright issue #38001](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/issues/38001).

Until Playwright implements a first-class solution for this, failing the currently running test on stderr output from a server can be achieved in many cases by creating a wrapper script `exit-on-stderr.ts` which will exit the server on any stderr output:

`exit-on-stderr.ts`

```ts
#!/usr/bin/env node

/* eslint-disable no-console -- Allow console logging in script
 */

import { spawn } from 'node:child_process';

const [cmd, ...args] = process.argv.slice(2);

if (!cmd) {
  console.error('Usage: ./exit-on-stderr.ts <command> [args...]');
  process.exit(1);
}

const child = spawn(cmd, args, { stdio: ['inherit', 'pipe', 'pipe'] });

child.stdout.pipe(process.stdout);
child.stderr.once('data', (data: Buffer) => {
  process.stderr.write(data);
  process.stderr.write(
    '[exit-on-stderr] Detected stderr output from child process, exiting.',
  );
  // Avoid Playwright overwriting [exit-on-stderr] message
  process.stderr.write('\n\n');

  child.kill();
  process.exit(1);
});

child.on('exit', (code) => process.exit(code ?? 1));
```

Create the script above, make it executable and update the Playwright `webServer` configuration to use the script using at least Node.js v22.18.0+:

```bash
chmod +x ./exit-on-stderr.ts
```

```diff
 import type { PlaywrightTestConfig } from '@playwright/test';
 
 const config: PlaywrightTestConfig = {
   webServer: [
     {
-      command: 'pnpm run frontend',
+      command: './exit-on-stderr.ts pnpm run frontend',
       env: {
         PLAYWRIGHT: 'true',
       },
       port: 3000,
     },
     {
-      command: 'pnpm run backend',
+      command: './exit-on-stderr.ts pnpm run backend',
       port: 3010,
     },
   ],
 };

 export default config;
```

Example Playwright logs when using `exit-on-stderr.ts` (ideally paired with [Fail test on internal server error, thrown errors, `console.log()`, `console.error()`](#fail-test-on-internal-server-error-thrown-errors-consolelog-consoleerror)):

```bash

## Import custom file types in tests

As of Sep 2025, Playwright doesn't support importing file types beyond JavaScript and TypeScript in tests:

- [[Feature] Support adding custom loaders to the test runner `#26822`](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/issues/26822)
- [[Feature]: Support importing SCSS in ESM `#31689`](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/issues/31689)

To import file types like MDX, image files, SCSS and others in Playwright tests, use Node.js ESM loaders via [Customization Hooks](https://nodejs.org/api/module.html#customization-hooks) APIs in `playwright.config.ts`.

For example, [`@nodejs-loaders/media`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nodejs-loaders/media) for image files and [`@mdx-js/node-loader`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mdx-js/node-loader) for MDX files:

`playwright.config.ts`

```ts
import { register } from 'node:module';
import type { PlaywrightTestConfig } from '@playwright/test';

// Node.js ESM loaders for image files and MDX imported by test files
// - https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/issues/26822#issuecomment-2692835230
register('@nodejs-loaders/media', import.meta.url);
register('@mdx-js/node-loader', import.meta.url);

const config: PlaywrightTestConfig = {
  // ...
};
 
export default config;
```

To import SCSS or other file types in Playwright tests, find a suitable Node.js ESM loader for the file type and use `register()` from `node:module` in `playwright.config.ts`.

## Interoperable text snapshots

Playwright does not add a newline at the end of files created with [non-image snapshots](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-snapshots#non-image-snapshots) - the text snapshots created with `expect().toMatchSnapshot()` - as discussed in [`microsoft/playwright#33416`](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/issues/33416).

This means that the following code will create a file `snapshot.txt` with the content `abc`, without any newline at the end:

```ts
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test('example test', () => {
  expect('abc').toMatchSnapshot('snapshot.txt');
});
```

Snapshot files without newlines at the ends are problematic because commonly-used software like the GitHub "Edit in Place" feature and other common editor configurations will silently add a newline in the edge case of editing a snapshot file, which will cause the snapshot test to fail in a confusing way.

Also, [POSIX and *nix tools assume newlines at the end of files](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/729692/why-should-text-files-end-with-a-newline), so Playwright text snapshots will not play nice with those.

Unless the Playwright team reverses [their "working as intended" decision](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/issues/33416#issuecomment-2455936144) and adds a fix to make text snapshots interoperable Create interoperable, this needs to be worked around.

[The current workaround](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/issues/33416#issuecomment-2456363012) to create robust text snapshots with Playwright is to manually adding a newline at the end of the string passed to `expect()`:

```ts
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test('example test', () => {
  expect(
    'abc' +
      // Make Playwright snapshot file interoperable
      // - https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/issues/33416#issuecomment-2456363012
      '\n',
  ).toMatchSnapshot('snapshot.txt');
});
```

## Load all lazy images

Scroll to all visible lazy-loaded images and wait for [successful loading of image](#test-image-loading):

```ts
const lazyImages = await page.locator('img[loading="lazy"]:visible').all();

for (const lazyImage of lazyImages) {
  await lazyImage.scrollIntoViewIfNeeded();
  await expect(lazyImage).not.toHaveJSProperty('naturalWidth', 0);
}
```

Be aware, [using `.all()` can be problematic if new images are being added, removed, shown or hidden while the test code is running](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/issues/31737).

One workaround for this is to assert the length of the `.all()` array (if you know it) to wait for it to stabilize:

```ts
const lazyImagesLocator = page.locator('img[loading="lazy"]:visible');

// Assert on length to wait for image visibility to stabilize
// after client-side JavaScript hides some images
// https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/issues/31737#issuecomment-2233775909
await expect(lazyImagesLocator).toHaveCount(13);

const lazyImages = await lazyImagesLocator.all();

for (const lazyImage of lazyImages) {
  await lazyImage.scrollIntoViewIfNeeded();
  await expect(lazyImage).not.toHaveJSProperty('naturalWidth', 0);
}
```

## Screenshot comparison tests of PDFs

Playwright does not (as of June 2024) have support for [visual comparison testing](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-snapshots) with PDFs.

There are [many issues asking for this feature](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/issues?q=is%3Aissue+sort%3Aupdated-desc+pdfs+is%3Aclosed), but the current position of the Playwright team is that [PDF.js should be used instead](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/issues/19253#issuecomment-1338955863), to render the PDF to a canvas.

It's not clear how the Playwright team suggests to do this, but one way is to navigate to `about:blank`, use [`page.setContent()`](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-page#page-set-content) to add a PDF.js viewer to the page, which accepts a URL, and then use [`expect(page).toHaveScreenshot()`](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-pageassertions#page-assertions-to-have-screenshot-2):

```ts
// HTML template string no-op for VS Code highlighting / formatting
function html(strings: TemplateStringsArray, ...values: unknown[]) {
  return strings.reduce((result, string, i) => {
    return result + string + (values[i] ?? '');
  }, '');
}

test('PDF has screenshot', async ({ page }) => {
  // Go to page without Content-Security-Policy header, to avoid CSP
  // prevention of script loading from https://mozilla.github.io
  await page.goto('about:blank');

  await page.setContent(html`
    <!doctype html>
    <html>
      <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8" />
      </head>
      <body>
        <canvas></canvas>
        <script src="https://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/build/pdf.mjs" type="module"></script>
        <script type="module">
          pdfjsLib.GlobalWorkerOptions.workerSrc =
            'https://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/build/pdf.worker.mjs';

          try {
            const pdf = await pdfjsLib.getDocument(
               'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mozilla/pdf.js/ba2edeae/examples/learning/helloworld.pdf',
            ).promise;

            const page = await pdf.getPage(1);
            const viewport = page.getViewport({ scale: 1.5 });

            const canvas = document.querySelector('canvas');
            canvas.height = viewport.height;
            canvas.width = viewport.width;

            await page.render({
              canvasContext: canvas.getContext('2d'),
              viewport,
            }).promise;
          } catch (error) {
            console.error('Error loading PDF:', error);
          }
        </script>
      </body>
    </html>
  `);

  await page.waitForTimeout(1000);

  await expect(page).toHaveScreenshot({ fullPage: true });
});
```

## Sync Playwright version from `package.json` to GitHub Actions container image

When using GitHub Actions, Playwright tests should be run [via containers using the official Microsoft Docker image](https://playwright.dev/docs/ci#via-containers) for performance - the slower alternative of [installing browsers with `playwright install --with-deps`](https://playwright.dev/docs/ci#on-pushpull_request) can take [5x as long](https://github.com/karlhorky/repro-dynamic-playwright-container-image#why) (or even longer) compared to the Docker image.

However, the Docker container approach hardcodes the Playwright version in a new place in the codebase - the GitHub Actions workflow files - requiring effort or automation to keep the Playwright versions in sync in both `package.json` and the GitHub Actions workflow files. There is a high chance of these versions getting out of sync as Playwright is upgraded.

To sync the Playwright version from `package.json` to the container image used in GitHub Actions, first make sure you use an exact version of Playwright in your `package.json` - this will be the single source of truth:

`package.json`

```json
{
  "devDependencies": {
    "@playwright/test": "1.55.0"
  }
}
```

Once you have the exact version in `package.json`, read out the version with `yq` in a minimal job, set it as output and then use the output in the second job to set the Docker image version in the [`jobs.<job_id>.container.image`](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/how-tos/write-workflows/choose-where-workflows-run/run-jobs-in-a-container#defining-the-container-image) expression:

`.github/workflows/ci-container.yml`

```yaml
name: CI
on: [push]
jobs:
  resolve-playwright-version:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    outputs:
      version: ${{ steps['resolve-playwright-version'].outputs.version }}
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v5
      - name: resolve-playwright-version
        id: resolve-playwright-version
        run: |
          version="$(yq -r '.devDependencies["@playwright/test"] // .dependencies["@playwright/test"] // ""' package.json)"
          test -n "$version" || { echo "No @playwright/test version found in package.json"; exit 1; }
          echo "version=$version" >> "$GITHUB_OUTPUT"

  ci:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: resolve-playwright-version
    timeout-minutes: 15
    container:
      image: mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v${{ needs['resolve-playwright-version'].outputs.version }}
      options: --user 1001
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v5
      - uses: pnpm/action-setup@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v5
        with:
          node-version: 'lts/*'
          cache: 'pnpm'
      - run: pnpm install
      - run: pnpm playwright test
```

## Test image loading

Test that `<img>` elements have a `src` attribute that is reachable and responds with image data:

```ts
const img = page.locator('img');
await expect(img).not.toHaveJSProperty('naturalWidth', 0);
```
